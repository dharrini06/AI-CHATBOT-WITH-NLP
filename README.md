DESCRIPTION:

The Book Recommendation Chatbot developed in this task is a lightweight, interactive Python application that provides personalized book suggestions based on user input. Designed using a simple rule-based approach, the chatbot functions entirely offline without the need for external APIs or databases, making it accessible and easy to use in low-resource environments. At the heart of this chatbot lies a mock book database that categorizes titles into popular genres such as thriller, romance, science fiction, fantasy, self-help, biography, mystery, and historical fiction. Each genre is mapped to a short curated list of well-known books, allowing the bot to deliver quick and relevant recommendations. The chatbot uses Python's built-in re module (regular expressions) to scan the user's message for any mention of these genres, and once a match is found, it replies with a list of titles from that category. The bot operates in a loop, continuously accepting user queries until the user types an exit command such as “exit,” “quit,” or “bye,” after which the chatbot ends the session politely. What makes this project valuable is its beginner-friendly nature—it requires no machine learning or natural language processing frameworks and instead focuses on teaching logic, condition handling, string processing, and user interaction within Python. This chatbot is an excellent educational tool for understanding how real-world chatbot systems process input and respond meaningfully, even with a basic keyword-based system. The application demonstrates a clear separation of logic: the database is structured independently, the genre-detection function is modular, and the main loop manages user interaction. The design makes it easy to expand in the future, allowing for the inclusion of new genres, more book recommendations, or even advanced features like reading level detection or sentiment-based suggestions.  It reflects how even minimal tools and logic can be combined to create helpful, real-time applications that add value to users seeking quick suggestions and personalized assistance.
